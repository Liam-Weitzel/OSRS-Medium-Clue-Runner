CATASTROPHIC FAILURES:
	MISCLICKS on PLACEHOLDER (disable when opening bank if enabled)
	Widget not found erros?? (TELEPORTING WIDGETS)
	Whileloop the closing of bank and opening of GE and closing of GE, and depositing all in the middle of the BANKING case to avoid failures due to misclicks
	Whileloop the equipping of gear in banking to avoid catastrophic failure by misclick
	Whenever player can be attacked during anagram, make sure to not do the anagram whilst he is in combat and activate autoretaliate and add a little fighting/ eating case
	EMOTE clues use all ITEMS as a key identifier instead of only one to avoid misclick failure
	VERY RARELY STILL GETS STUCK SELECTING ITEM DURING IMPLING OPENING (UNSELECT IN THE START OF WALKING TO BANK...)
	While loop the withdrawal of money when going to sell
	Drop all items that arent needed before opening the casket
	Close the medium clue if open in walking to bank
	Remove double webnoding (dreambot added webnodes to the karamja dungeon and crandor)


ANNOYANCES:
	Hardcoded fairy ring codes get misstyped 2/3 times
	EMOTE clues dont use SLOT interact but just interact, sometimes throws error but does continue with no problem...
	Somtimes teleports twice (ADD SLEEPS)
	Talking too fast on anagrams, ciphers and some cryptic clues, has to repeat the talking sometimes (ADD SLEEPS) (maybe ADD CONDITIONAL SLEEP UNTIL MESSAGE CONTAINS)
	Failing to toggle autoretaliate (maybe replace all with a widget interaction)
	SET MOUSE SPEED AND KEYBOARD WPM
	Sometimes tries to cancel item selling when its the last item being sold and nothing else is collectable
	Instead of saying setump complete = 1 when all his inventory is complete maybe do else if (and reprint the if statements above) or do an array with all items missing and get those
	setupcomplete = 1 in banking only procs when amount of empty slots is equal to 5;
	Reset scroll to 0 for music clues before scrolling to new music
	Spirittree sometimes sleeps very long/ has to retry
	Put the dbinsert after the character is logged in so that it does not show up as null when you start the bot from login screen
	DB update in bank & Add a ranger boot check in the bank if the variable is not equal to count and then ofc send message


OPTIMIZATIONILIITY:
	Consider wether before buying always is a good idea (maybe every 3rd time?)
	Consider how much money to bring on each trip (withdraw 100k)
	Consider how many charges of each teleport to bring (ring of wealth(4 and 3) okey?)
	Consider whether Stampot 3's are allowed
	Consider the zoom level of the bot
	Consider stopping limit with moneeyy (100k seems like very little, prolly do more like 200k)
	

FUNCTIONALITY:
	Take one stampot instead of two and bring an antidote and add the buying of antidote to the banking statement
	Global statement to (go bank if no food is in inv and player health is below 20%) OR if player is poisoned {if player is poisoned {drink antipoison} else if player health <= 20% { backing=1 setupcomplete=0}} OR do a check as the first if statement in every case
	DROP/ DESTROY ALL KEYS AND CHALLANGE CLUES when in bank
	Mix stam pots(2 and 1) together
	COSTUM SLEEPS SO U DONT HAVE TO USE DREAMBOT SLEEPS (might fuck with script)
	OPTIONAL READING OF CLUES with normally distributed reading time
	Occasional camera resets (on a timer) && When a digspot is buggy
	Decant all jewelery that can be decanted
